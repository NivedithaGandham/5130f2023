Weekly Project Progress Report 1Title: Beyond The PagesThis week I learned and tried to create a navigation bar with links to sections such as “Your Profile”, “About us”, “App Features”, “Search Stories”. I tried including a user profile to know the user who is using the app by displaying user-specific details with including an image, username, email and location and I’m planning more categories to make the creative user profile. I am trying to create a paragraph to explain about the app and what we trying to give the users through our app. Then we tried to include a feature section where I tried highlighting the key features, enabling users to rate stories, create and share their own stories, access a diverse book library, and engage with a reading community. Then we included a search input field and a button to search for stories. In further we are trying to make a commented-out sections for “Featured stories”,” User Testimonials, “App Download”, “FAQs”, “Newsletter Subscription”, “Contact Information”, and “Social Media Links” and so on. As for I learned how to structure a basic yet functional website, employing sections for user profile, platform details, and features highlights, aiming to engage users through storytelling interactivity.My Contribution  : I established the foundation structure of the webpage by defining essential section, such as the user profile, app features, and a search function. I outlined various sections for future implementation, indicating a strategic approach for testimonials, featured stories, FAQs, a newsletter subscription and contact details. By referencing external style and script files , “style.css” and “script.js”, I set groundwork for incorporating styles and functionality beyond the HTML structure.
